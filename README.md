**GreenStash** is a simple [FOSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) android app to help you plan and manage your savings goals easily and establish the habit of saving money.

**Important Note (Don't ignore);**
If you were using any previous version before v2.0, please DO NOT UPDATE and do CLEAN INSTALLATION (by uninstalling the <= v1.9 and installing >= v2.0 ) instead. As the app has been completely re-written from scratch in v2.0 release with an entirely new database schema, redesigned UI/UX and reworked backend. Hence, this release is not compatible with the older versions.

<h2 align="center">Donations</h2>

If this project helped you a little bit, please consider donating a small amount to keep the projects going, Your donations helps ensure that my open source projects are actively maintained. You can donate via following mediums:

[![Github-sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-30363D?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub-Sponsors&logoColor=#EA4AAA)](https://github.com/sponsors/starry-shivam)
[![Bitcoin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bitcoin-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=bitcoin&logoColor=white)](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q82qh9hw5xupwlf0f3ddfud63sek53lavk6cf0k)
[![Ethereum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ethereum-3C3C3D?style=for-the-badge&logo=Ethereum&logoColor=white)](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x9ef20ad6FBf1985e6eF6ea6337ad800Cb8126eD3)

Or you could just buy the app from Google Play Store. You'll get constant updates without the need to get all the way here and download the release all by yourself and install the release all by yourself and then you realize you have a different package name so you contact me but I really don't have time for this so I update it on google play and then you realize your installer doesn't work and then you realize your whole life is like this, miserable and not working but then you see a point of light in the distance so you run towards and and it's the "Buy" button in the GreenStash's page on google play, it'll make your life easier.

<h2 align="center">Translations</h2>

If you want to make app available in your language, you're very welcome to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your translation file.
The string resources can be found under `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. It is easiest to make a translation using the Android Studio XML editor, but you can always go with your favorite XML-text editor instead.
