Please keep in mind that you cannot update F-droid builds over any other builds due to signature mismatch. (F-droid builds are signed by F-droid's own keys while others are signed with my own private key) if you wish to migrate over F-droid releases you can take backup of app data and restore it after installing F-droid version.

### üôå Translations
If you want to make app available in your language, you're very welcome to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your translation file.
The string resources can be found under `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. It is easiest to make a translation using the Android Studio XML editor, but you can always go with your favorite XML-text editor instead.
Checkout this guide to learn more about translation strings from [Helpshift](https://developers.helpshift.com/android/i18n/) for Android.
